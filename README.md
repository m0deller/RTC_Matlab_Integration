# RTC_Matlab_Integration

## Intro
This project provides an integration adapter between Mathworks Simulink Projects and IBM Rational Team Concert Change and Configuration Management.
The adapter is a customisation of the SVN adapter provided in the Mathworks SDK, using a command line interface to drive RTC CCM. It requires the RTC scm tools to function.

## Getting Started
This project has been developed using eclipse (actually Team Concert). Download the source, then build by running the build.xml Ant script.
